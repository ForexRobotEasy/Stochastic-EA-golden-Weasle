# Stochastic EA Golden Weasle

This code represents an expert advisor (EA) for trading in the forex market using the Stochastic indicator. The EA is designed to open and close positions based on the signals generated by the Stochastic indicator.

## Input Parameters

- MaxPositions: Maximum number of positions that can be opened at a time.
- Volume: Desired volume for trading.
- DynamicVolume: Enable dynamic volume adjustment based on account balance.
- TopProfitLevel: The profit level at which open positions will be closed.
- StopLossBuy: Stop loss level for buy positions.
- StopLossSell: Stop loss level for sell positions.
- OperateWithoutStopLoss: Option to operate without a stop loss.

## How it Works

The EA uses the `OnTick` function to continuously analyze the market and make trading decisions based on the Stochastic signals. Here's how it works:

1. The Stochastic indicator is calculated using the `iStochastic` function to get the main line and the signal line values.
2. If the main line is above the signal line, a buy signal is generated.
   - If the maximum number of positions has not been reached (`MaxPositions`), a buy position is opened using the `OrderSend` function.
   - The volume of the position is determined based on the `Volume` input parameter, and it can be adjusted dynamically based on the account balance if `DynamicVolume` is enabled.
   - The stop loss level for the position is set to `StopLossBuy` unless `OperateWithoutStopLoss` is enabled.
3. If the main line is below the signal line, a sell signal is generated.
   - All open buy positions for the symbol are closed using the `OrderClose` function.
   - The stop loss level for the buy positions is set to `StopLossBuy` if it is not already set.
4. Profit management based on the specified profit level (`TopProfitLevel`) is implemented.
   - If the profit of an open position reaches or exceeds the `TopProfitLevel`, the position is closed using the `OrderClose` function.
